## 👋 Welcome to the contribute.design examples repository

We're trying to consolidate a solid list of templates and guidelines for open source projects to use in their `.design` folder.

Keep in mind – the intention here is to have designers participate in creating and extending these docs.

## 💅 The guides

You can find the guides right here:

- [**Minimal**](/1-minimal/DESIGN.md) – A single DESIGN.md in the root with the least amount of information designers require to be able to collaborate.
- [**Basic**](/2-basic/.design) – If you want to keep your process scalabe – take this sample.
- [**Extended**](3-extended/.design) – A more in deep example of good design contribution guidelines.
- [**Full Fledged**](/4-full-fledged/.design) – Use this if you really want to shine at designers.


## ❤️ Contribute to our guides

We're very open to your ideas and input. Read our own .design guidelines to contribute to this project.
