## 👋 Welcome to the contribute.design examples repository

We're trying to consolidate a solid list of templates and guidelines for open source projects to use in their `.design` folder.

## 💅 The guides

You can find the guides right here:

- [**Minimal**](/1-minimal/.design) – A sample with the least amount of information designers require to be able to collaborate.
- [**Basic**] (/2-basic/.design) – A basic example of proper design contribution guidelines.
- [**Extended**] (/1-extended/.design) – Use this if you really want to shine at designers.
- **Fully Fledged** (TBD) – We still don't know how far to go here 😀

## ❤️ Contribute to our guides

We're very open to your ideas and input. Read our own .design guidelines to contribute to this project.
