## 👋 Welcome to the contribute.design examples repository

We're trying to consolidate a solid list of templates and guidelines for open source projects to use in their `.design` folder.

Keep in mind – the intention here is to have designers participate in creating and extending these docs.

> We encourage you to start small with our Minimal template and extend your setup over time to the more sophisticated guides.

## 🗄 What's in the box?

Our guides include the following building blocks: 

1. **GitHub Issue Template** - 
A template for new issues created within your repository which helps designers to phrase their thoughts in a more structured way.

2. **Design guidelines** -
The juice for every designer. It should contain enough information and context on your project to help designers start contributing.


## 🎓 The guides

You can find the guides right here:

- [**Minimal**](/1-minimal/) – A single DESIGN.md in the root with the least amount of information designers require to be able to collaborate.
- [**Extended**](/2-extended/) – A more in deep example of good design contribution guidelines.
- [**Full Fledged**](/3-full-fledged/) – Use this if you really want to shine at designers.


## 🚀 Copy & Get started

Copy the folders/files into your repository and you're ready to go.
