  <h1>🚢 How to contribute design</h1>
</div>

## 👋 Intro

We're trying to keep our process as lean as possible with a big focus on delivering value. That said we appreciate designers who are pro-active and foster innovation.

## 🏗 Our Process

1. We typically create GitHub [issues](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/issues) with a `design: 💅required`) label and try to give enough context to understand the required work.
2. We do acceppt new issues which can be labeled as `design: 💡idea` and will foster discussions around this idea.
3. Our designers work in publicly available Figma files. Feel free to clone them or create new ones. Make sure to make them publicly available and include links to relevant Figma views in the issue.
4. Issues will then be picked by the team and will receive further feedback for iterations or be accepted by the team and implemented.
5. Ideally we will label Pull Requests with a `design: review` to get the last designer feedback on an implementation.


## ✅ Do's

- Feel empowered to think out of the box and contribute the wildest thoughts and ideas. 
- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/discussions) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xxxxxxxxx).
- Check out our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)


## ❌ Don't's

- Don't feel ashamed if you don't understand something. We're here to help and share the same goals as you: Creating an amazing product. 
- Don't feel blamed. You are not your work. Our critique is never meant towards you!
