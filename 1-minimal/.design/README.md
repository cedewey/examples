## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma files if available or create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

We encourage you to:

- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/discussions) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xxxxxxxxx).
- Check out our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## ðŸš€ Our Main Product

Our main product can be found over here: https://acme.io
You can create an account for free and login to discover all the flows.

### Target audience

Since we are creating a product for everyone we target people from 8 to 99 â€“Â across the board without any specifics. Your project might be different though. So please make sure to describe one or more of your target users as good as possible.
### Design files

> Since we do not have a design team at hand â€“Â most of our product does not have any Design files and you'll be forced to browse through the product itself and propose improvements.

- We do have a rough Figma mock of our Dashboard:
[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/xxxxxx)

- You could also link to screenshots or other visuals in here.
